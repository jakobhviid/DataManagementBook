	abstract = {Commercial buildings have long since been a primary target for ap-plications from a number of areas: from cyber-physical systems to building energy use to improved human interactions in built envi-ronments. While technological advances have been made in these areas, such solutions rarely experience widespread adoption due to the lack of a common descriptive schema which would reduce the now-prohibitive cost of porting these applications and systems to different buildings. Recent attempts have sought to address this issue through data standards and metadata schemes, but fail to cap-ture the set of relationships and entities required by real applica-tions. Building upon these works, this paper describes Brick, a uni-form schema for representing metadata in buildings. Our schema defines a concrete ontology for sensors, subsystems and relation-ships among them, which enables portable applications. We demon-strate the completeness and effectiveness of Brick by using it to represent the entire vendor-specific sensor metadata of six diverse buildings across different campuses, comprising 17,700 data points, and running eight complex unmodified applications on these build-ings.},

@article{Balaji2018,
	abstract = {Buildings account for 32{\%} of worldwide energy usage. A new regime of exciting new “applications” that span a distributed fabric of sensors, actuators and humans has emerged to improve building energy efficiency and operations management. These applications leverage the technological advances in embedded sensing, processing, networking and methods by which they can be coupled with supervisory control and data acquisition systems deployed in modern buildings and with users on mobile wireless platforms. There are, however, several technical challenges to confront before such a vision of smart building applications and cyber-physical systems can be realized. The sensory data produced by these systems need significant curation before it can be used meaningfully. This is largely a manual, cost-prohibitive task and hence such solutions rarely experience widespread adoption due to the lack of a common descriptive schema. Recent attempts have sought to address this through data standards and metadata schemata but fall short in capturing the richness of relationships required by applications. This paper describes Brick, a uniform metadata schema for representing buildings that builds upon recent advances in the area. Our schema defines a concrete ontology for sensors, subsystems and the relationships between them, which enables portable applications. We demonstrate the completeness and effectiveness of Brick by using it to represent the entire vendor-specific sensor metadata of six diverse buildings across different campuses, comprising 17,700 data points, and running eight unmodified energy efficiency applications on these buildings.},

However, they are not currently programmable in a meaningful sense because each building is constructed with vertically inte- grated, closed subsystems and without uniform abstrac- tions to write applications against. We develop a set of operating system services called BOSS, which supports multiple portable, fault-tolerant applications on top of the distributed physical resources present in large commer- cial buildings. We evaluate our system based on lessons learned from deployments of many novel applications in our test building, a four-year-old, 140,000sf building with modern digital controls, as well as partial deploy- ments at other sites.},

We present our design for a simple RESTful web service called the Simple Measuring and Ac- tuation Profile (sMAP) which allows instruments and other producers of physical information to directly publish their data. In our design study, we consider what information should be represented, and how it fits into the RESTful paradigm. To evaluate sMAP, we implement a large number of data sources using this profile, and consider how easy it is to use to build newapplications. We also design and evaluate a set of adaptations made at each layer of the protocol stack which allow sMAP to run on constrained devices.},

	abstract = {Buildings often have several systems installed (i.e. different forms of Building Management Systems (BMS)), with the combined goal of providing a good comfort level for the occupants of the building. With such a goal, it would be natural for such systems to share information and collaborate in achieving this goal, but often they work as silos. Improving at scale the energy performance of buildings depends on applications breaking these silos and being portable among buildings. To enable portable building applications, the building instrumentation should be supported by a metadata layer, describing the instrumentation of the building. We have created Metafier, a tool for annotating and structuring metadata for buildings. Metafier optimizes the workflow of establishing metadata for buildings by enabling a human-in-the-loop to validate, search and group points. We have evaluated Metafier for two buildings, with different sizes, locations, ages and purposes. The evaluation was performed as a user test with three subjects with different backgrounds. The evaluation results indicates that the tool enabled the users to validate, search and group points while annotating metadata. One challenge is to get users to understand the concept of metadata for the tool to be useable. Based on our evaluation, we have listed guidelines for creating a tool for annotating building metadata.},

	abstract = {Retail stores use a considerable amount of energy each year. Therefore, this type of building is important to consider for providing demand-side flexibility services. However, existing work on demand-side flexibility has only considered narrow aspects of the loads and opportunities in retail buildings. This paper details a study on the current state of electronic devices and practices in different types of retail stores, as well as the flexibility potential. Four different retail store types were inspected, cataloged, and analyzed together with their energy usage. The results highlight large percentages of the stores are too diverse to group into usable categories. The usual categories are present, like Lighting, Frost, Cooling, Comfort Cooling, Ventilation, and one unexpected group; ovens. In the Supermarket screened, the ovens took up 60{\%} of the flexibility potential and about 19{\%} of the Hypermarkets. Flexibility potential numbers are detailed, as well as the current ability to control the loads. Retail stores are different from other sectors in regards to their motivations for upgrading installations. Some of the notable requirements, potential challenges, and barriers to realizing the flexibility potential are highlighted in relation to these motivations. In conclusion, the current state of the controllable devices, and the granularity of which they can be controlled is found to be lacking severely if they are to be integrated into a modern demand response system. As retail stores are regularly renovated an opportunity exists to introduce required technologies across stores if a business case exists at a faster pace than in other building types.},
