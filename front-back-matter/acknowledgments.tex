\undodrop

For as far as i can remember, I have had this view of researchers and prominent people in the world, of being impossibly confident and big perfect icons.
Throughout the \phd, though, I learned that even the big icons are humans, just like the rest of us, doing what they can to further the knowledge of humanity. 
They are as insecure and had the same struggles, and all learned to improve who they are, and what they do.
This, for me, is what a \phd embodies.
The never-ending pursuit for perfection in who you are, what you do, and how you do it.

Also, I would like to thank my family for the patience, and sincerely \textit{\textbf{trying}} to understand my feeble attempts to explain what I am doing in this \phd, even though I seem to keep failing thoroughly in this endeavour.
